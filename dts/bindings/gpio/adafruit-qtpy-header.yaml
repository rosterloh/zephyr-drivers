    GPIO pins exposed on Adafruit QT Py headers.

    The Adafruit QT Py layout provides two headers, along opposite
    edges of the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 7-pin Digital/Analog Input header.  This has input signals
      labeled from 0 at the top through 6 at the bottom.
    * An 7-pin header Power and Digital/Analog Input header.  This
      has three power pins, followed by four inputs labeled 10 at the
      top through 7 at the bottom.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 10 pins where parent pins 0
    through 10 correspond to D0 through D10, as depicted below:

        0 A0                     5V  -
        1 A1                     GND -
        2 A2                     3V  -
        3 A3                     MO  10
        4 SDA                    MI  9
        5 SCL                    SCK 8
        6 Tx                     Rx  7
